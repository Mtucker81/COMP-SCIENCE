        Project planning is the process of defining your objectives and scope, 
        your goals and milestones (deliverables), and assigning tasks and budgetary resources for each step.
         A good plan is easily shareable with everyone involved, 
         and it's most useful when it's revisited regularly.
    </p>
    <h3>system analysis</h3>
    <p>
        The basic outline of any project plan can be summarized in these five steps:
         Define your project's stakeholders, scope, quality baseline, deliverables, milestones,
          success criteria and requirements.
         Create a project charter, work breakdown structure (WBS) and a statement of work (SOW)
    </p>

    The Project Planning Matrix (PPM) enables decision
     makers to identify project purposes and goals and plan for project outputs and inputs. 
    The technique is used for planning projects,
     providing an objective basis to evaluate projects and to state assumptions about causal linkages.

    This Implementation Matrix describes how the policies and actions in the C2C Plan should be carried out. ... 
    These action items are already being implemented, and, as such,
     built into existing work programs and other plans.
     The Implementation Matrix is broken into key Action Areas related to the chapters of the C2C Plan

    Planning may be defined as deciding in advance what to be done in future. 
    It is the process of thinking before doing. 
    It involves determination of goals as well as the activities required to be undertaken to achieve the goals. ...
